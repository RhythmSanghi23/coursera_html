            HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
          </div>
          <p>
            In this course, I learnt the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. I started from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. I then advanced to learn how to code my pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. I was able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, I got to learn the ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, I was able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.

            Data Science using Python
          </div>
          <p>
            Data Science is the hottest field of the century. I learnt about why data science, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are revolutionizing the way people do business and research around the world. In this course I was introduced to the learner to the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, data structures , and the numpy library. The course introduced me to data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, I was able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.

          Node-RED: Basics to Bots
          </div>
          <p>
            In this course, I learnt how to use the Node-RED flow editor to wire application components together to make a chatbot application. Got hands-on experience and learnt how to convert speech to text, analyze tone, translate text into different languages, send tweets through Twitter, add audio and video capabilities, and set up a chatbot using the IBM Watson Assistant (formerly Conversation) service and Facebook Messenger.
